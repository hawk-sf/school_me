# school_me #
A Flask app for accessing data on San Francisco public schools, with utility classes for scraping California Department of Education website for data files and their schemas.

## The Present ##
Currently just proof of concept, so I can play around with mapbox/leaflet.

## The Future ##
A resource for parents in San Francisco to access publicly available data on the schools in their district. No opaque "school scores"; just the numbers and tools for easy visualization and comparison.
